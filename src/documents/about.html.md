##About me

``` javascript
{
    Name: "Anders Daniel Thomsen",
    Occupation: "Developer",

### What I do
In my day job I develop web sites on the .NET platform using a wide variety of tools and techniques.

### What I also do
What I also do, which is probably more interesting, is try to get my hands dirty with all the new stuff that emerges around developing software and especially around web development. I love trying out new technologies and tools and I'm always looking for things that can make me a better all-round developer.

##About this site
On this site I write about anything tech related that sparks my interest. Also I post about nifty little tricks I come about in my life, both when it comes to programming but also about life in general.
